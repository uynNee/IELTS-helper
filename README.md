# Flask OpenAI README

This README provides instructions on what needs to be installed to run a Flask application that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model. The application uses the Flask web framework, and the OpenAI Python library for interacting with the GPT-3.5 model.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the necessary dependencies:

### 1. Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The Flask application requires Python 3.6 or later. You can download Python from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Flask

Install Flask, which is a lightweight web framework for Python:

```
pip install flask
```

### 3. OpenAI Python Library

Install the OpenAI Python library to interact with the GPT-3.5 language model:

```
pip install openai
```

### 4. Set OpenAI API Key

To use the OpenAI library, you need to have an OpenAI API key. Follow the OpenAI documentation to obtain your API key: [https://openai.com/docs/authentication/](https://openai.com/docs/authentication/)

Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

Alternatively, you can set the API key directly in your Flask application code. Be cautious when doing this as it may expose your API key if the code is shared or uploaded to a public repository.

### 5. Other Dependencies

If your Flask application requires additional dependencies, make sure to install them using `pip` or any other package manager you prefer.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can use the provided code as a starting point for your Flask application.

In your Python file, import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template, redirect
import openai
import difflib
import os
import re
```

You can then define your Flask application and start building your routes and views. Refer to the Flask documentation for more information on how to create routes and views: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

To use the OpenAI library, you will need to initialize it with your API key. Add the following code to your application setup:

```python
openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

You can then start utilizing the OpenAI library within your Flask routes or views.

## Example

Here's an example of a basic Flask route that uses the OpenAI library:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Get user input from the form
        user_input = request.form['input']

        # Call the OpenAI API to generate a response
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine='text-davinci-003',
            prompt=user_input,
            max_tokens=100
        )

        # Extract the generated response from the API response
        generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()

        # Render the template with the generated text
        return render_template('index.html', generated_text=generated_text)

    # Render the initial form
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
